# Optimization-for-Vehicle-Routing-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithms
This repository contains a Python code file that solves the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Genetic Algorithms. The VRP is a complex combinatorial optimization problem that aims to determine the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers.
